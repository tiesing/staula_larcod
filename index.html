            There are many children in this area who are vulnerable and/or orphan and many women who are widows due to the impact of poverty and diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS has had a negative effect on both the individuals who are infected, and their family members and community.
            LARCOD is helping vulnerable Kenyan children achieve an education and empowering youth and women to rise above poverty and work toward a brighter future.
